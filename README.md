Hello My name is Benjamin Kotey

The following app you are about to view is an android application created in android studio that will take an image from the external storage and classify it in the app using ML from Pytorch(Resnet-18).

Notice: I apologize for the incovience, the app is not truly complete. The element of using resmet-18 to classify the image and the mapping of the class is not there however, everything else is there and fully functional.

Part 1: loading the app Important: Android Studios SDK and certain emulators API are almost constantly updating so make sure that the code can run on the current cersion of Android Studio.

When you open the app on your PC(on android studio) the code will open. After a few seconds everything will pop up. Secondly, you must choose your android emulator (API 30 or higher) once you have downloaded the emulator you can now run the app

Part 2: Running the app When you click on the run, the emulator tan will open up and begin to connect and install the app to the emulator. Once that step is complete, the app should automatically open up

Part 3: Selecting and classifiying image Once you enter the app you will be greeted to take the photo. Then you will will select the photo. Once you press that button, the app will ask a permission to access your photo/storage. Once you accept, you will able to select the image. Once it is done, you will click detect and it will classify the class of the image.

Closing remarks I plan on properly finshing the app at a later point.

Thank you


To Professor Choudhury, I ran into an issue where my app didn't look like the example it currenly has a "night theme" on it. I hope that is ok
